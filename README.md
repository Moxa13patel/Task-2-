# Task-2-
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Objective:
The primary goal of this EDA task is to understand the dataset thoroughly using statistical summaries and visualizations, which helps in uncovering underlying patterns, trends, and anomalies that can guide further analysis.

Tools Used:

Pandas for data manipulation and computing summary statistics

Matplotlib for foundational plotting

Seaborn for advanced and aesthetically pleasing statistical visualizations

Plotly for interactive data exploration

Process Overview:

Summary Statistics:
Computed key statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and range for numeric features to capture their central tendencies and spread.

Visualizations for Numeric Features:
Utilized Seaborn and Matplotlib to create histograms and boxplots that reveal data distributions and detect outliers.

Feature Relationship Analysis:
Employed Seabornâ€™s pairplot and correlation heatmap to analyze relationships and correlations between features.

Pattern and Anomaly Detection:
Identified significant patterns, trends, and anomalies through both statistical summaries and visual inspection of the plots.

Feature-Level Inferences:
Drew initial conclusions from the visuals, such as skewness, clusters, correlations, and outliers, to better understand the data characteristics.
